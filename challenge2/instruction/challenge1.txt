Create a simple game of pong, according to the following description;

1) The game-area should be rectangular with longer horizontal sides, with walls up and down and open sides to the left and right. Paddles for the two players should be 1/10 of the height of the sides and be able to move up and down to (hopefully) catch moving balls.

2) There should be a dividing line (only for decoration, so has no impact on ball movement) in the middle of the game-area.

3) When a game begins, the ball should be created on a random spot with a random direction and a reasonably slow speed.

4) When the ball hits a wall, it will change direction 90 degrees (inwards towards the game area).

5) When the ball hits a paddle it should change direction depending on wich part of the paddle it hits. Divide the paddle into eight parts which spread ball bounces in different directions from much to the left to much to the right.

6) When the ball hits a paddle its speed will also increase by 20%.

7) When the ball goes outside the game-area, the player opposite the outgoing side gets a point and the ball reset/respawns.

8) Draw current points for each player on the top right and top left of the game above the game-area.

9) Let each player simultaneously control his/her paddle by using the keyboard.
