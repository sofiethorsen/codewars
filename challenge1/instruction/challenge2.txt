Now create two aoutomatic 'bot' players that can play alog together.

1) A bot player should only be able to move three times a second and at most 1/10 of the height of the short-end side at a time.

2) First try out your bot player to play against a human keybord player.

3) Then make it possible to let two bots play against each other.
