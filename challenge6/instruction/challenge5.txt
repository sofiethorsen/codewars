Change the shape of the game-area from square to hexagonal

1) Keep the right and left openings which are protected by the player's paddles.

2) Exchange the straight horizontal upper wall with two walls at 30 degree angles to the player sides. Do the dame with the lower wall, forming a proper hexagon of the game-area with two open sides across each other. 

3) Make sure the overall gameplay works on the new game-area. The ball should bounce according to the same rules as before.
