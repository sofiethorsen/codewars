Create a client-server game where a human player plays against a bot player.

1) Create a simple server (http, for example) which simulates the game.

2) The server should know where ball and paddles are and move them according to speed and direction or input. 

3) The server should be able to be polled at least four times a second about ball and paddle positions.

4) Move the bot logic into the server so that it can play against a human player on the client.

5) Remove the game logic in the client with client logic which polls the server and displays current positions of ball, paddles and points.

6) Make the client render ball, paddles and players points polled from the server.

7) From this point on, all challenges implies this client-server, so additions to the protocol will become nesessary even if they are not explicitly stated.
